Description

=======================

an immersive sleep and romance mod for Fallout 4 

The goal of Sleep Intimate is to change game-play for more immersive, role-playing experience with sleep and romance. Watch your character sleep, interrupt sleep to continue later, and risk interruption by storms. The normal romantic companion bonus is now considered like a snuggle-bonus, but to get more intimate use intimacy skills. Successful persuasion results in pre-bed animated scene earning a new bonus. Intimate scenes are silly dances plus your imagination and may be disabled if just looking for a new sleep experience.

How to sleep: activate 'Rest' for immersive rest or 'Sleep' for normal game sleep.

Create holotape [Settings] Sleep Intimate at chem station to adjust preferences. MCM includes basic preferences only.

Sort dialogue overhauls after SleepIntimate.esp.
